# LeetCode Problem-Solving Strategy for Interviews

## The UMPIRE Method

A systematic approach to tackle any coding problem during interviews.

### U - **Understand**
### M - **Match**
### P - **Plan**
### I - **Implement**
### R - **Review**
### E - **Evaluate**

---

## üéØ Phase 1: UNDERSTAND (2-3 minutes)

### Ask Clarifying Questions
- **Input constraints:** What are the size limits? Can inputs be empty/null?
- **Output format:** What exactly should I return? 
- **Edge cases:** What happens with invalid inputs?
- **Assumptions:** Can I assume inputs are sorted? Are there duplicates?

### Example Questions:
```
"Can the array be empty?"
"Are there any constraints on the values?"
"Should I handle negative numbers?"
"What should I return if no solution exists?"
"Can I modify the input array?"
```

### Restate the Problem
- Paraphrase the problem in your own words
- Confirm your understanding with the interviewer
- Identify the core requirements (like we did with Core Requirements sections)

---

## üîç Phase 2: MATCH (1-2 minutes)

### Identify Problem Patterns
Recognize which category the problem falls into:

#### **Array/String Problems:**
- Two pointers (palindromes, sorted arrays)
- Sliding window (substring problems)
- Prefix/suffix arrays (range queries)

#### **Tree/Graph Problems:**
- BFS (level order, shortest path)
- DFS (path finding, connectivity)
- Binary search trees (search, insert, delete)

#### **Dynamic Programming:**
- Optimization problems (min/max)
- Counting problems
- Decision problems (can/cannot)

#### **Common Patterns:**
- **Hash Map:** Fast lookups, counting, grouping
- **Stack:** Parentheses, nested structures, monotonic problems
- **Queue:** BFS, level processing
- **Heap:** Top K problems, priority-based
- **Binary Search:** Sorted data, optimization

### Pattern Recognition Examples:
```
"This looks like a two-pointer problem because..."
"I see this is asking for optimization, so DP might work..."
"Since we need fast lookups, a hash map could be useful..."
```

## üìã Phase 3: PLAN (3-5 minutes)

### Start with Brute Force
- Always think of the simplest solution first
- Analyze its time/space complexity
- This shows you understand the problem

### Optimize Step by Step
- Identify bottlenecks in brute force
- Apply appropriate data structures/algorithms
- Consider trade-offs between time and space

### Write Pseudocode
```
1. Initialize variables
2. Main processing loop
3. Handle edge cases
4. Return result
```

### Example Planning Process:
```
"First, I'll try the brute force O(n¬≤) approach..."
"Then I can optimize using a hash map to get O(n)..."
"Let me trace through an example to verify..."
```

---

## üíª Phase 4: IMPLEMENT (10-15 minutes)

### Coding Best Practices

#### Start with Function Signature
```python
def solutionName(self, param1: Type, param2: Type) -> ReturnType:
    # Your code here
    pass
```

#### Use Meaningful Variable Names
```python
# Good
left_pointer, right_pointer = 0, len(arr) - 1

# Bad
i, j = 0, len(arr) - 1
```

#### Write Clean, Readable Code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use helper functions when appropriate
- Handle edge cases explicitly

#### Implementation Template:
```python
def problemSolution(self, inputs):
    # Step 1: Handle edge cases
    if not inputs:
        return default_value
    
    # Step 2: Initialize variables
    result = []
    # ... other variables
    
    # Step 3: Main algorithm
    for item in inputs:
        # Process each item
        pass
    
    # Step 4: Return result
    return result
```

### Talk Through Your Code
- Explain your thought process as you write
- Mention time/space complexity of each section
- Point out key decisions and trade-offs

---

## üîç Phase 5: REVIEW (2-3 minutes)

### Test with Examples
- Walk through provided examples
- Trace through your algorithm step by step
- Verify output matches expected results

### Check Edge Cases
- Empty inputs
- Single element
- Maximum constraints
- Invalid inputs

### Code Review Checklist
- **Syntax:** Any typos or syntax errors?
- **Logic:** Does the algorithm handle all cases?
- **Edge cases:** Are they properly handled?
- **Efficiency:** Can it be optimized further?

### Example Testing:
```python
# Test with provided examples
test_input = [1, 2, 3, 4]
expected = [2, 4, 6, 8]
result = solution(test_input)
print(f"Input: {test_input}, Expected: {expected}, Got: {result}")
```

---

## üìä Phase 6: EVALUATE (1-2 minutes)

### Complexity Analysis
Always provide Big O analysis:

```
Time Complexity: O(n log n) - due to sorting step
Space Complexity: O(1) - only using constant extra space
```

### Discuss Optimizations
- "Could we optimize this further?"
- "What if we had different constraints?"
- "Are there trade-offs we should consider?"

### Alternative Approaches
Mention other solutions briefly:
```
"An alternative approach would be using a heap, 
which would give us O(n log k) time complexity..."
```

## üéØ Interview-Specific Tips

### Communication is Key
- **Think out loud:** Share your reasoning process
- **Ask for feedback:** "Does this approach make sense?"
- **Admit uncertainties:** "I'm not sure about this part, let me think..."

### Time Management
- **Understand (15%):** 2-3 minutes
- **Plan (25%):** 3-5 minutes  
- **Implement (60%):** 10-15 minutes
- **Review & Evaluate (10%):** 2-3 minutes

### When You're Stuck
1. **Go back to examples:** Trace through manually
2. **Simplify:** Solve for smaller input first
3. **Ask for hints:** "Could you give me a hint about the approach?"
4. **Discuss trade-offs:** Show you understand different solutions

### Red Flags to Avoid
- ‚ùå Jumping straight to code without planning
- ‚ùå Being silent while coding
- ‚ùå Not testing your solution
- ‚ùå Ignoring edge cases
- ‚ùå Not discussing complexity

## üõ† Problem Categories & Strategies

### Array/String Problems
```python
# Two Pointers Template
def twoPointers(arr):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        # Process current pair
        if condition:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return result
```

### Tree Problems
```python
# DFS Template
def dfs(node):
    if not node:
        return base_case
    
    left = dfs(node.left)
    right = dfs(node.right)
    
    # Process current node
    return combine(left, right, node.val)
```

### Dynamic Programming
```python
# DP Template
def dp_solution(n):
    # Initialize DP table
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = base_case
    
    # Fill DP table
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i] = transition_function(dp, i)
    
    return dp[n]
```
