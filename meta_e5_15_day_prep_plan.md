## 🔁 Daily Routine

1. **Warm-up (15 mins):**
   - One easy-medium problem

2. **Main Practice (90–120 mins):**
   - 2–3 LeetCode problems (Medium-heavy focus)

3. **Mock Interview (every 2–3 days):**
   - Simulate 45-minute interview
   - Use Pramp, Interviewing.io, or a peer

4. **CS Review (60 mins):**
   - Watch/read one key concept (e.g. Graphs, Big O)

5. **Review (30 mins):**
   - Analyze your mistakes
   - Re-implement if needed

## 🧠 Must-Know CS Concepts

- Big O Time & Space Complexity
- Recursion vs Iteration
- Tree Traversals (Inorder/Pre/Post)
- Graph Traversal (DFS, BFS)
- Memoization vs Tabulation (DP)
- Edge Case Identification
- Hashing Techniques

---

## 🗣️ Interview Communication Tips

- Clarify assumptions before coding
- Talk through your thought process
- Use examples and test cases early
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Optimize and explain trade-offs

---

## 📆 Final Days Strategy

### Day 13–14
- Review most missed patterns (e.g., sliding window, DP)
- Skim all notes and starred problems
- Do 2 timed mock sessions

### Day 15
- Rest, sleep well, light review only
- Visualize success, stay calm & confident
